# LuxiQR: The Luxury QR Code Generator

Reinventing the wheel, one Quick Response Code at a time.

This is a project simply to learn how QR code generation works. There are a plethora of QR code generators in the wild,
so choose which one suits your needs best.

## Primary Objectives

- Understand how different data is encoded into a QR code
- Learn how to do polynomial math for Reed-Solomon error correction
- Implement settings customization for more control over the final generation
- Have various different output options for maximum integration compatibility

## â›” Current Version Inoperable

Although the code technically "generates" something, that something is not a functional QR code. I believe the issue to be with the GF(256) math in regards to the error correction generation.

To view tests along the generation process, use the following:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use supergnaw\LuxiQR\LuxiQR;
use supergnaw\LuxiQR\LuxiQRTest;

require_once './vendor/autoload.php';

$test = new LuxiQRTest();
```
